## Using TypeQL Grammar

> Note: All TypeDB Clients, as well as TypeDB Console, accept TypeQL syntax natively. If you are using TypeDB, you do not need additional libraries/tools to use TypeQL syntax natively.
> However, if you would like to build a "Language Library" for TypeQL so you can construct TypeQL queries programmatically in your preferred language, you may use TypeQL Grammar library listed below.

### Java

If you would like to develop language TypeQL plugins or extension in Java, and require the TypeQL grammar library, you can import the following Maven package.
